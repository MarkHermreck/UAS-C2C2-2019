This folder contains the code that will:
1. Send gps coordinates to the drone.
2. Wait for drone to return to receive files


Important notes:
1. This file uses the same EndOfFile stop message as everything else.
   This means that the program may stop while the drone stops to receive information from the ISUs.  
   If this happens, it is recommended to stop the program with ctrl+c, then restart the program.
   
2. In order to run this program, you will need to install pyserial.
